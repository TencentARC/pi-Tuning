# Checkpoints

We provide links for you to download checkpoints, including pretrained and finetuned models. 

## Pretraining

You can download pretrained checkpoints for backbone to conduct PETL on different tasks. Below we show the official links to download OFA checkpoints.

## Finetuning (OFA-Large)

We provide multiple PETL checkpoints on OFA-Large for RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg tasks as well as $\pi$-tuning checkpoints based on them.
